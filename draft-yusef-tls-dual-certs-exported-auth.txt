    Post-Quantum Traditional (PQ/T) Hybrid Authentication with Dual
         Certificates Using Exported Authenticators in TLS 1.3
            draft-yusef-tls-dual-certs-exported-auth-latest

Abstract

   This document extends the TLS 1.3 authentication mechanism to allow
   the use of two certificates to enable dual-algorithm authentication,
   ensuring that an attacker would need to break both algorithms to
   compromise the TLS session.

   It defines a mechanism using Exported Authenticators defined in
   RFC9261 to enable authentication with a traditional certificate
   during the TLS handshake and PQC certificate after the TLS handshake.

1.  Introduction

   There are several potential mechanisms to address concerns related to
   the anticipated emergence of cryptographically relevant quantum
   computers (CRQCs).  While the encryption-related aspects are covered
   in other documents, this document focuses on the authentication
   component of the TLS 1.3 handshake.

   One approach is the use of dual certificates: issuing two distinct
   certificates for the same end entity, one using a traditional
   algorithm (e.g., ECDSA), and the other using a post-quantum (PQ)
   algorithm (e.g., ML-DSA).

   This document defines how TLS 1.3 [RFC8446] can utilize such
   certificates to enable dual-algorithm authentication, ensuring that
   an attacker would need to break both algorithms to compromise the TLS
   session.

   It also addresses the challenges of integrating hybrid authentication
   in TLS 1.3 while balancing backward compatibility, forward security,
   and deployment practicality.

   This document leverages Exported Authenticators [RFC9261] to
   authenticate with a traditional certificate during the TLS handshake
   and a PQC certificate after the TLS handshake.

2.  Terminology and Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Scope

   This document is intended for use in closed-network deployments where
   a single entity manages both the TLS peers.  It is not designed for
   deployments where TLS peers operate in public networks.

   This approach is also compatible with deployments that require
   compliance with FIPS certification, as it allows the use of existing
   FIPS-approved traditional signature algorithms during the TLS
   handshake.  This ensures that systems can remain compliant with FIPS
   while still incorporating post-quantum authentication using Exported
   Authenticators.

   The mechanism is fully backward compatible, as traditional
   certificates and authentication continue to work with existing TLS
   1.3 implementations.  As CRQCs emerge, deployments can progressively
   transition by disabling traditional authentication and enabling pure
   PQ-based authentication.  This flexibility ensures that long-term
   security, compliance and backward compatibiltiy can be maintained
   without disruption to existing infrastructure.

4.  Design of Dual Certificate Authentication

   There are several approaches for conveying two certificate chains and
   demonstrating possession of the corresponding private keys.

   The approach outlined in the document assumes two distinct
   certificate-based authentication exchanges during the TLS handshake
   and post-handsake.  [RFC9261] relies on the application-layer
   protocol to carry the Certificate, CertificateVerify, and Finished
   messages outside the initial handshake.  Unlike the post-handshake
   authentication mechanism defined in TLS 1.3, [RFC9261] supports
   mutual authentication, allowing both client and server to
   authenticate after the handshake.

5.  Post-Handshake PQ Certificate Using Exported Authenticators

   In scenarios where TLS endpoints wish to authenticate using a
   traditional certificate during the TLS handshake (for compliance or
   performance reasons) and use a PQ certificate for long-term
   cryptographic assurance, [RFC9261] provides a suitable framework.

   In such deployments, either endpoint (client or server) can perform
   traditional certificate-based authentication during the TLS
   handshake.  Following the handshake, an Authenticator Request can be
   initiated by either party, and the responding peer provides a post-
   quantum certificate using an Exported Authenticator.  This
   authenticator includes the PQ certificate, a corresponding
   CertificateVerify, and a Finished message.

   This bidirectional authentication approach ensures that post-quantum
   identities are strongly bound to the underlying TLS connection while
   maintaining backward compatibility with existing TLS implementations
   and minimizing initial handshake overhead.

   The use of dual-certificate authentication via Exported
   Authenticators is useful where post-quantum algorithms introduce
   significant performance or message size impacts that are best avoided
   during the TLS handshake.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

7.  Security Considerations

7.1.  Downgrade and Zero-Day Attack Protection

   The mechanism proposed in this document is designed to mitigate a
   range of cryptographic transition risks.

7.2.  Dual Authentication Binding

   By using a traditional certificate during the TLS handshake and a PQ
   certificate after the handshake via Exported Authenticators
   [RFC9261], the solution ensures that authentication relies on two
   distinct algorithms.  The security of the session is hardened because
   an attacker must break both the traditional and the post-quantum
   algorithms to successfully impersonate a peer.

   This dual-layered authentication can help defend against downgrade
   attacks, in which a CRQC-enabled adversary compromises one of the
   algorithms (e.g., a traditional certificate) and attempts to suppress
   the stronger authentication stage.  However, protection against such
   attacks depends entirely on the deployment's connection policy which
   must enforce that PQ authentication using Exported Authenticators is
   required and that connections lacking it are rejected.  In such
   environments, the TLS session's trustworthiness ultimately depends on
   the stronger of the two algorithms.

7.3.  Resilience to Zero-Day CRQC Attacks

   The proposed mechanism also anticipates a zero-day scenario, where
   CRQCs become available and are exploited covertly much like the
   sudden exploitation of a software vulnerability.  In such cases,
   victims may unknowingly rely on compromised traditional algorithms
   for authentication.

   The use of PQ authentication after the handshake ensures that:

   *  Even if the handshake (traditional) certificate is silently broken
      by a CRQC,

   *  The attacker will still have to break the post-handshake PQ
      authentication bound to the session.

   This layered approach buys time for the ecosystem to detect, respond,
   and transition securely, even under zero-day attacks.

7.4.  Resilience to PQ Algorithm Implementation Failures

   This mechanism also accounts for the possibility of implementation
   vulnerabilities or future cryptanalytic breakthroughs affecting post-
   quantum algorithms (e.g., ML-DSA).  If a flaw enables certificate
   forgery, the traditional authentication step offers a fallback layer
   of assurance.

7.5.  Migration to PQ-Only Authentication

   The proposed approach is fully backward compatible with existing TLS
   1.3 implementations and can be deployed incrementally in closed-
   network environments.  It enables gradual adoption of post-quantum
   (PQ) authentication without requiring changes to the TLS handshake
   itself.

   As the cryptographic landscape evolves, deployments can adapt by
   updating the TLS configuration.  With the anticipated availability of
   CRQCs in the near future, deployments will be able to disable the use
   of traditional certificates during the handshake and rely solely on
   PQ certificates.

   This flexibility supports a graceful migration path, beginning with
   hybrid (traditional + PQ) authentication for cryptographic resilience
   and backward compatibility, and evolving toward pure PQ
   authentication as cryptographic confidence and ecosystem readiness
   mature.

   Further, this model can avoid the need for dual truststore
   transitions when used in conjunction with composite certificates.
   Composite certificates allow a single certificate structure to
   support both traditional and PQ algorithms.
